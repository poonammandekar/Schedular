The Pune University, Computer Science Department(PUCSD) University of Pune is a teaching department that aims at providing quality education in Computer Science.
As with any education institution, students give the department a dynamic character and an active culture towards Computer Science, guided by their faculty. 
Apart from teaching postgraduate level Computer Science, the faculty is also involved in research, consultancy and development programs. 
The support structure of the department provides all the required non-academic support to the students and the faculty.
Details of most of our activities can be found on this site. 
PUCSD takes care to ensure that the basic scientific principles of Computer Science are presented to the student and actively tries to point out the differences between the Computation as a science and software. 
Our mission statement elucidates this point further. 
Another characteristic academic experience at PUCSD for the student is the almost lack of any divide between Computer Science theory and practice. 
We try our best to maintain a 24x7 availability of our resources.
